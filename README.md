![Build CI](https://github.com/deephaven-examples/deephaven-ib/actions/workflows/build-and-publish.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)

An [Interactive Brokers](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/) integration for [Deephaven](https://deephaven.io).

[Interactive Brokers](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/) is a very popular brokerage in the quantitative finance world,
with about $200B of customer equity.  Quants and hedge funds often choose [Interactive Brokers](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/) because of its low trading costs and API that facilitates automated trading.  With low minimum account balances, 
it is also an attractive choice for individual investors.

[Deephaven](https://deephaven.io) is the real-time query engine that is the backbone for the quantitative trading of the 
world's largest hedge funds, banks, and exchanges.  [Deephaven](https://deephaven.io) makes working with real-time data easy and
facilitates very concise and easy-to-read code.  With [Deephaven](https://deephaven.io), quants can create new models 
and get them into production quickly, traders can monitor the market and their portfolios, and 
managers can monitor risk. 

[deephaven-ib](https://github.com/deephaven-examples/deephaven-ib) combines the low-cost trading of 
[Interactive Brokers](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/) with the analytical power and ease of use of 
[Deephaven Community Core](https://github.com/deephaven/deephaven-core) to yield an open, quantitative 
trading platform.  Basically, it provides an open platform for building quantitative trading strategies and
custom analytics.  You can build something simple, like a portfolio monitor, or something complex, like a 
fully-automated, multi-strategy quantitative hedge fund.

[deephaven-ib](https://github.com/deephaven-examples/deephaven-ib) supports trading essentially all common
exchange traded products.  These include:
* Stocks
* Mutual Funds
* Options

# Data Available in Deephaven

The [Deephaven](https://deephaven.io) query engine is built around the concept of tables, which are similar to Pandas dataframes.  
Unlike Pandas dataframes, [Deephaven](https://deephaven.io) tables can dynamically update as new data is streamed in.
As input tables change, the [Deephaven](https://deephaven.io) query engine ensures that all queries, no matter how complex, 
are kept up-to-date. 

Once data is converted to a [Deephaven](https://deephaven.io) table, it can be used in queries with any other 
[Deephaven](https://deephaven.io) tables.

## IB TWS data

Data available from [IB Trader Workstation (TWS)](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/trading/tws.php) can be accessed 
as [Deephaven](https://deephaven.io) tables by using [deephaven-ib](https://github.com/deephaven-examples/deephaven-ib).
As data streams in, the tables and queries using them will automatically update.

These tables include:

* General
    * `errors`: an error log
    * `requests`: requests to IB
* Contracts
    * `contract_details`: details describing contracts of interest.  Automatically populated.
    * `contracts_matching`: contracts matching query strings provided to `request_contracts_matching`.
    * `market_rules`: market rules indicating the price increment a contract can trade in.  Automatically populated.
    * `short_rates`: interest rates for shorting securities.  Automatically populated if `download_short_rates=True`.

    * `bars_historical`: historical price bars requested via `request_bars_historical`.
    * `bars_realtime`: real-time price bars requested via `request_bars_realtime`.
* Order Management System (OMS)
    * `orders_submitted`: submitted orders **FOR THE THE CLIENT'S ID**.  A client ID of 0 contains manually entered orders.  Automatically populated.
    * `orders_status`: order statuses.  Automatically populated.
    * `orders_completed`: completed orders.  Automatically populated.
    * `orders_exec_details`: order execution details.  Automatically populated.
    * `orders_exec_commission_report`: order execution commission report.  Automatically populated.

Most tables include a `ReceiveTime` column.  This column indicates the time the data was received by [deephaven-ib](https://github.com/deephaven-examples/deephaven-ib). It does not represent the time the event occurred.

## Your data

You may want to combine data from other sources with your IB data.  [Deephaven](https://deephaven.io) can load data from:
* [CSV](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/how-to-guides/csv-import/)
* [Parquet](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/how-to-guides/parquet-flat/) 
* [Kafka](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/how-to-guides/kafka-topics/).  
See the [Deephaven Documentation](https://deephaven.io/core/docs) for details.

Files placed in the `./docker/data/` directory are visible in the Docker container at `/data/`.  
See [Access your file system with Docker data volumes](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/conceptual/docker-data-volumes/) for details.

## Launch

There are multiple ways to launch [Deephaven](https://deephaven.io) with [deephaven-ib](https://github.com/deephaven-examples/deephaven-ib) 
installed.  The launch can either happen via a local installation or via Docker images.

For a Docker Compose example, see [docker/release/](docker/release/).


### (Option 1) Launch pip-installed Deephaven with Docker -- interactive

The pip-installed Deephaven uses a lightweight Deephaven installation that is installed using pip.  In this case,
the pip-installed Deephaven system is installed in a Docker container.

1) Create a directory for your data and scripts
    ```bash
    mkdir data
    ```
2) Create a directory for your Deephaven IDE configuration and notebooks
   ```bash
   mkdir `pwd`/.deephaven
   ```
3) Launch the system:
    ```bash
    # Set jvm_args to the desired JVM memory for Deephaven
    docker run -it -v data:/data -v `pwd`/.deephaven:/storage -p 10000:10000 ghcr.io/deephaven-examples/deephaven-ib python3 -i -c "from deephaven_server import Server; _server = Server(port=10000, jvm_args=['-Xmx4g']); _server.start()"
    ```
4) Launch the [Deephaven IDE](https://github.com/deephaven/deephaven-core/blob/main/README.md#run-deephaven-ide) by navigating to [http://localhost:10000/ide/](http://localhost:10000/ide/) in a browser.


### (Option 2) Launch pip-installed Deephaven with Docker -- run a script

The pip-installed Deephaven uses a lightweight Deephaven installation that is installed using pip.  In this case,
the pip-installed Deephaven system is installed in a Docker container.  
This is a good option for production scenarios where scripts need to be run and related data needs to be visualized.

1) Create a directory for your data and scripts
    ```bash
    mkdir data
    # your_script.py must begin with: "from deephaven_server import Server; _server = Server(port=10000, jvm_args=['-Xmx4g']); _server.start()"
    # Set jvm_args to the desired JVM memory for Deephaven
    cp path/to/your_script.py data/your_script.py
    ```
2) Create a directory for your Deephaven IDE configuration and notebooks
   ```bash
   mkdir `pwd`/.deephaven
   ```
3) Launch the system:
    ```bash
    # Set jvm_args to the desired JVM memory for Deephaven
    docker run -it -v data:/data -v `pwd`/.deephaven:/storage -p 10000:10000 ghcr.io/deephaven-examples/deephaven-ib python3 -i /data/your_script.py
    ```
4) Launch the [Deephaven IDE](https://github.com/deephaven/deephaven-core/blob/main/README.md#run-deephaven-ide) by navigating to [http://localhost:10000/ide/](http://localhost:10000/ide/) in a browser.


### (Option 3) Launch pip-installed Deephaven with a local installation (No Docker) -- interactive

The pip-installed Deephaven uses a lightweight Deephaven installation that is installed using pip.  In this case,
the pip-installed Deephaven system is installed directly on your local system, without Docker.

It is possible to use [deephaven-ib](https://github.com/deephaven-examples/deephaven-ib) without docker, but this is a 
new feature and has not been well tested.  To do this:
1) Install `ibapi`:
    ```bash
    # pip installed version of ibapi is too old.  You must download and install a more recent version.
    export IB_VERSION=1016.01
    curl -o ./api.zip "https://interactivebrokers.github.io/downloads/twsapi_macunix.${IB_VERSION}.zip"
    unzip api.zip
    cd ./IBJts/source/pythonclient
    python3 setup.py install
    ```
2) Install Java 11 and set the appropriate `JAVA_HOME` environment variable.    
3) Install [deephaven-ib](https://github.com/deephaven-examples/deephaven-ib):
    ```bash
    pip3 install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
    pip3 install deephaven-ib
    ```
4) Launch the system:
    ```bash
    # Set jvm_args to the desired JVM memory for Deephaven
    # Deephaven IDE configuration and notebooks are stored to ~/.deephaven
    python3 -i -c "import os; from deephaven_server import Server; _server = Server(port=10000, jvm_args=['-Xmx4g','-Dstorage.path=' + os.path.expanduser('~/.deephaven')]); _server.start()"
    ```
5) Launch the [Deephaven IDE](https://github.com/deephaven/deephaven-core/blob/main/README.md#run-deephaven-ide) by navigating to [http://localhost:10000/ide/](http://localhost:10000/ide/) in a browser.
6) Use `host="localhost"` for the hostname in the examples (Windows WSL uses `host="host.docker.internal"`, since WSL is built on Docker.)

### (Option 4) Launch pip-installed Deephaven with a local installation (No Docker) -- run a script

The pip-installed Deephaven uses a lightweight Deephaven installation that is installed using pip.  In this case,
the pip-installed Deephaven system is installed directly on your local system, without Docker.  
This is a good option for production scenarios where scripts need to be run and related data needs to be visualized.

It is possible to use [deephaven-ib](https://github.com/deephaven-examples/deephaven-ib) without docker, but this is a 
new feature and has not been well tested.  To do this:
1) Install `ibapi`:
    ```bash
    # pip installed version of ibapi is too old.  You must download and install a more recent version.
    export IB_VERSION=1016.01
    curl -o ./api.zip "https://interactivebrokers.github.io/downloads/twsapi_macunix.${IB_VERSION}.zip"
    unzip api.zip
    cd ./IBJts/source/pythonclient
    python3 setup.py install
    ```
2) Install Java 11 and set the appropriate `JAVA_HOME` environment variable.    
3) Install [deephaven-ib](https://github.com/deephaven-examples/deephaven-ib):
    ```bash
    pip3 install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
    pip3 install deephaven-ib
    ```
4) Launch the system and execute a custom script:
    ```bash
    # your_script.py must begin with: "import os; from deephaven_server import Server; _server = Server(port=10000, jvm_args=['-Xmx4g','-Dstorage.path=' + os.path.expanduser('~/.deephaven')]); _server.start()"
    # Deephaven IDE configuration and notebooks are stored to ~/.deephaven
    # Set jvm_args to the desired JVM memory for Deephaven
    python3 -i your_script.py
    ```
5) Launch the [Deephaven IDE](https://github.com/deephaven/deephaven-core/blob/main/README.md#run-deephaven-ide) by navigating to [http://localhost:10000/ide/](http://localhost:10000/ide/) in a browser.
6) Use `host=localhost` for the hostname in the examples


# Use deephaven-ib

To use [deephaven-ib](https://github.com/deephaven-examples/deephaven-ib), you will need to open the [Deephaven Web IDE](http://localhost:10000/ide/) 
by navigating to [http://localhost:10000/ide/](http://localhost:10000/ide/) in your web browser.  The following commands
can be executed in the console.

## Connect to TWS

All [deephaven-ib](https://github.com/deephaven-examples/deephaven-ib) sessions need to first create a client for interacting 
with [IB Trader Workstation (TWS)](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/trading/tws.php).

`host` is the computer to connect to.  When using [deephaven-ib](https://github.com/deephaven-examples/deephaven-ib) inside
of Docker, `host` should be set to `host.docker.internal`.  

`port` is the network port [IB Trader Workstation (TWS)](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/trading/tws.php)
communicates on.  This value can be found in the [IB Trader Workstation (TWS)](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/trading/tws.php)
settings.  By default, production trading uses port 7496, and paper trading uses port 7497.  See [Setup](#setup) and [TWS Initial Setup](https://interactivebrokers.github.io/tws-api/initial_setup.html) for more details.

`read_only` is a boolean value that is used to enable trading.  By default `read_only=True`, preventing trading.  Use `read_only=False` to enable trading.

`is_fa` is a boolean value that is used to indicate if an account is a financial advisor (FA) account or a regular acccount. 
 By using `is_fa=True`, FA account configuration details are requested.  By default `is_fa=False`.  
 If `is_fa=True` is used on a non-FA account, everything should work fine, but there will be error messages.
 If `is_fa=False` (the default) is used on a FA account, FA account configurations will not be populated in tables such as
 `accounts_groups`, `accounts_allocation_profiles`, and `accounts_aliases`.

`order_id_strategy` is the strategy used for obtaining new order ids.  Order id algorithms have tradeoffs in execution time, support for multiple, concurrent sessions, and avoidance of TWS bugs.
* `OrderIdStrategy.RETRY` (default) - Request a new order ID from TWS every time one is needed.  Retry if TWS does not respond quickly.  This usually avoids a TWS bug where it does not always respond.
* `OrderIdStrategy.BASIC` - Request a new order ID from TWS every time one is needed.  Does not retry, so it may deadlock if TWS does not respond.
* `OrderIdStrategy.INCREMENT` - Use the initial order ID sent by TWS and increment the value upon every request.  This is fast, but it may fail for multiple, concurrent sessions connected to TWS.

For a read-write session that allows trading:
```python
import deephaven_ib as dhib

client = dhib.IbSessionTws(host="host.docker.internal", port=7497, read_only=False)
client.connect()
```

For a read-only session that does not allow trading:
```python
import deephaven_ib as dhib

client = dhib.IbSessionTws(host="host.docker.internal", port=7497, read_only=True)
client.connect()
```

For a read-only financial advisor (FA) session that does not allow trading:
```python
import deephaven_ib as dhib

client = dhib.IbSessionTws(host="host.docker.internal", port=7497, read_only=True, is_fa=True)
client.connect()
```

After `client.connect()` is called, TWS requires that the connection be accepted.
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deephaven-examples/deephaven-ib/main/docs/assets/accept-connection.png)

## Get data

[IB Trader Workstation (TWS)](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/trading/tws.php) data is stored in
the [deephaven-ib](https://github.com/deephaven-examples/deephaven-ib) client as two dictionaries of tables:
* `tables` contains the tables most users will want.  
* `tables_raw` contains raw [IB Trader Workstation (TWS)](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/trading/tws.php)
data.

As an example, the `requests` table, that contains all of the requests made to [IB Trader Workstation (TWS)](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/trading/tws.php),
can be obtained by:

```python
requests = client.tables["requests"]
```

To display all of the tables in the [Deephaven IDE](https://github.com/deephaven/deephaven-core/blob/main/README.md#run-deephaven-ide),
place the tables in the global namespace.  This can most easily be done by:

```python
for k, v in client.tables.items():
    globals()[k] = v
```

Similarly, raw tables can be viewed by:

```python
for k, v in client.tables_raw.items():
    globals()[k] = v
```

A list of available tables can be obtained by:

```python
print(client.tables.keys())
print(client.tables_raw.keys())
```

## Create a contract

In IB, financial contracts include:
* Stocks
* FX
* Cryptocurrency
* Indexes
* CFDs
* Futures
* Options
* Futures Options
* Bonds
* Mutual Funds
* Warrants
* Commodities

To create a contract for use in [deephaven-ib](https://github.com/deephaven-examples/deephaven-ib),
the contract must first be created as an `ibapi.contract.Contract`.  Once the contract is created,
it must be registered with [deephaven-ib](https://github.com/deephaven-examples/deephaven-ib) before it
can be used.  

Details on creating contracts can be found at 
[https://interactivebrokers.github.io/tws-api/basic_contracts.html](https://interactivebrokers.github.io/tws-api/basic_contracts.html).

Registering the contract causes the contract details to appear in the `contracts_details` table.

```python
from ibapi.contract import Contract

c = Contract()
c.symbol = 'AAPL'
c.secType = 'STK'
c.exchange = 'SMART'
c.currency = 'USD'

rc = client.get_registered_contract(c)
print(rc)
```

[./examples/example_all_functionality.py](./examples/example_all_functionality.py) illustrates the creation and registration
of many different types of contracts.

## Request market data

Market data can be requested from the client using:
* `request_market_data`
* `request_bars_historical`
* `request_bars_realtime`
* `request_tick_data_realtime`
* `request_tick_data_historical`

```python
from ibapi.contract import Contract

import deephaven_ib as dhib

# Use delayed market data if you do not have access to real-time
# client.set_market_data_type(dhib.MarketDataType.DELAYED)
client.set_market_data_type(dhib.MarketDataType.REAL_TIME)


c = Contract()
c.symbol = 'AAPL'
c.secType = 'STK'
c.exchange = 'SMART'
c.currency = 'USD'

rc = client.get_registered_contract(c)
print(rc)

client.request_market_data(rc)
client.request_tick_data_realtime(rc, dhib.TickDataType.BID_ASK)
client.request_tick_data_realtime(rc, dhib.TickDataType.LAST)
client.request_tick_data_realtime(rc, dhib.TickDataType.MIDPOINT)
```

[./examples/example_all_functionality.py](./examples/example_all_functionality.py) illustrates requesting
many kinds of market data.


## Request news

Market data can be requested from the client using:
* `request_news_historical`
* `request_news_article`

```python
from ibapi.contract import Contract

from deephaven.time import to_datetime

contract = Contract()
contract.symbol = "GOOG"
contract.secType = "STK"
contract.currency = "USD"
contract.exchange = "SMART"

rc = client.get_registered_contract(contract)
print(contract)

start = to_datetime("2021-01-01T00:00:00 NY")
end = to_datetime("2021-01-10T00:00:00 NY")
client.request_news_historical(rc, start=start, end=end)

client.request_news_article(provider_code="BRFUPDN", article_id="BRFUPDN$107d53ea")
```

[./examples/example_all_functionality.py](./examples/example_all_functionality.py) illustrates requesting
news data.

## Request account details

Standard account details are requested by default.  [IB Trader Workstation (TWS)](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/trading/tws.php)
does not provide an API for requesting all model codes, so [deephaven-ib](https://github.com/deephaven-examples/deephaven-ib)
can not subscribe to data for different model codes.  If you need details on non-standard
account / model code combinations, you can use:
* `request_account_pnl`
* `request_account_overview`
* `request_account_positions`

## Order management

Orders can be created and canceled using:
* `order_place`
* `order_cancel`
* `order_cancel_all`

To place an order, register a contract with [deephaven-ib](https://github.com/deephaven-examples/deephaven-ib),
and create an `ibapi.order.Order` containing details for the order.

Details on creating orders can be found at [https://interactivebrokers.github.io/tws-api/orders.html](https://interactivebrokers.github.io/tws-api/orders.html).

```python
from ibapi.contract import Contract
from ibapi.order import Order

contract = Contract()
contract.symbol = "GOOG"
contract.secType = "STK"
contract.currency = "USD"
contract.exchange = "SMART"

rc = client.get_registered_contract(contract)
print(contract)

order = Order()
order.account = "DF4943843"
order.action = "BUY"
order.orderType = "LIMIT"
order.totalQuantity = 1
order.lmtPrice = 3000
order.eTradeOnly = False
order.firmQuoteOnly = False

req = client.order_place(rc, order)
req.cancel()

client.order_place(rc, order)
client.order_cancel_all()

[Deephaven](https://deephaven.io) has very powerful query engine that allows mathematics and queries 
to be applied to static and real-time data.  The queries can be as simple as filtering data and
as complex as artificial intelligence.

The example below computes the real-time price ratio of `DIA` (Dow Jones Index) and `SPY` (S&P 500 Index)
every 5 seconds.

For more details, see the [Deephaven Coummunity Core Documentation](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/).

```python
from ibapi.contract import Contract

c1 = Contract()
c1.symbol = 'DIA'
c1.secType = 'STK'
c1.exchange = 'SMART'
c1.currency = 'USD'

rc1 = client.get_registered_contract(c1)
print(rc1)

c2 = Contract()
c2.symbol = 'SPY'
c2.secType = 'STK'
c2.exchange = 'SMART'
c2.currency = 'USD'

rc2 = client.get_registered_contract(c2)
print(rc2)

client.set_market_data_type(dhib.MarketDataType.REAL_TIME)
client.request_market_data(rc1)
client.request_market_data(rc2)
client.request_bars_realtime(rc1, bar_type=dhib.BarDataType.MIDPOINT)
client.request_bars_realtime(rc2, bar_type=dhib.BarDataType.MIDPOINT)

bars_realtime = client.tables["bars_realtime"]

bars_dia = bars_realtime.where("Symbol=`DIA`")
bars_spy = bars_realtime.where("Symbol=`SPY`")
bars_joined = bars_dia.view(["Timestamp", "TimestampEnd", "Dia=Close"]) \
    .natural_join(bars_spy, on="TimestampEnd", joins="Spy=Close") \
    .update("Ratio = Dia/Spy")
```

## Plotting

[Deephaven](https://deephaven.io) has very powerful plotting functionality for both static and real-time data.
The example below plots the bid and ask prices of `AAPL` for every tick in the market.

For more details, see the [Deephaven Coummunity Core Documentation](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/).

```python

from ibapi.contract import Contract

c = Contract()
c.symbol = 'AAPL'
c.secType = 'STK'
c.exchange = 'SMART'
c.currency = 'USD'

rc = client.get_registered_contract(c)
print(rc)

client.set_market_data_type(dhib.MarketDataType.REAL_TIME)
client.request_market_data(rc)
client.request_tick_data_realtime(rc, dhib.TickDataType.BID_ASK)

ticks_bid_ask = client.tables["ticks_bid_ask"]

from deephaven.plot import Figure

plot_aapl = Figure().plot_xy("Bid",  t=ticks_bid_ask, x="ReceiveTime", y="BidPrice") \
    .plot_xy("Ask",  t=ticks_bid_ask, x="ReceiveTime", y="AskPrice") \
    .show()
```

## Help!

### Error Table

[deephaven-ib](https://github.com/deephaven-examples/deephaven-ib) logs all [IB Trader Workstation (TWS)](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/trading/tws.php)
errors to the `errors` table.  This table should be monitored when using [deephaven-ib](https://github.com/deephaven-examples/deephaven-ib).

```python
errors = client.tables["errors"]
```

### Logging

[deephaven-ib](https://github.com/deephaven-examples/deephaven-ib) and `ibapi` both use Python's 
[`logging`](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html) framework.  By default, `ERROR` and higher
levels are logged.  More or less logging can be displayed by changing the logging level.

To see fewer log messages:
```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.CRITICAL)
```

To see all log messages:
```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

A discussion of available logging levels can be found in the [Python `logging` module documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html).
