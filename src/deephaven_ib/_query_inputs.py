"""Inputs to queries.

Currently Deephaven has an open ticket for using variables in queries from within python modules.
This module is to house nasty workaround code until the problem has been resolved.

https://github.com/deephaven/deephaven-core/issues/1072
"""

# TODO: When ticket #1072 is resolved, the following code should be replaced with something cleaner (https://github.com/deephaven-examples/deephaven-ib/issues/11)
# To work around the problem, variables have to be fed into QueryScope.
# Since python objects can't be inserted into QueryScope, PythonFunctions were created, which are Java objects.
# PythonFunctions only take a single argument, so the python functions had to be changed to take only one arument.
